Overview

The challenge involves completing the 'aaico_voice_processing_challenge.py' file. This file simulates the streaming of the 'audio_aaico_challenge.wav' audio file. Frame by frame, the "emit_data" thread emits the data of the audio file. Each frame consists of 512 samples, with a sample rate of 16000 Hz for the audio file.

The "process_data" thread receives these frames. Your task is to complete the code in this thread to label each received sample and save your label using the provided function "label_samples". A sample should be labeled 0 if it is detected as a command, otherwise 1 (we consider that everything that is not a command should be broadcast).

Once the code is executed, a 'results.pkl' file will be saved, which is an array containing for each sample:

The time at which the sample was emitted.
The label you assigned to the sample.
The time at which the sample was labelled.
